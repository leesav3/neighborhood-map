# Neighborhood Map Project - Taco Finder

This is a project completed as part of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. The requirements were to build a single page application featuring a map. The map includes highlighted locations, third party data about the locations and various ways to browse content. The project is written using the React framework and is fully responsive. It uses Google Maps API for map and marker data and Zomato's API for information pertaining to the locations. It is also has accesibility features and a service worker available if you run the app in production mode (see Installation Instructions for info)

Taco Finder contains a map showing 10 locations near Raleigh, NC that feature great tacos. You can filter restaurants by name and click on the map markers to see more information about each restaurant.
